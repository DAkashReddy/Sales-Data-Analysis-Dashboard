# Automobile Sales Data Exploration and Visualization Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of a comprehensive sales dataset. The primary goal is to extract actionable insights on sales performance, product popularity, customer behavior, and seasonal sales trends using advanced SQL queries and creating dynamic visualizations with Tableau.

## Objectives
- To dissect and understand sales data at a granular level.
- To identify key performance indicators such as revenue by product line, deal size, and country.
- To analyze sales trends over time and identify peak performance periods.
- To segment customers based on their purchasing patterns using RFM analysis.

## Tools Used
- **SQL Server**: For executing complex queries, including data aggregation, window functions, and CTEs.
- **Tableau**: For developing an interactive dashboard that displays insights derived from the sales data.

## Data Analysis
SQL queries were written to explore the dataset thoroughly. These queries facilitated:
- Understanding unique values and data distribution.
- Grouping sales by different attributes like product line and deal size.
- Evaluating sales performance across time periods.
- Performing customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.

## Dashboard Visualization
An intuitive dashboard was created in Tableau to visually represent the findings from the SQL analysis. It includes:
- Revenue by product line and country.
- Deal size distribution.
- Monthly sales trends.
- Customer distribution by country.

## Insights and Findings
From the analysis and dashboard, several insights were discovered:
- Revenue peaks and troughs were identified, correlating with specific months and product lines.
- Customer segmentation highlighted key groups that contributed most to sales, providing a target for marketing strategies.
- The relationship between deal size and sales revenue was elucidated, offering guidance on focusing sales efforts.

## How to Navigate the Repository
- The `sql_queries.sql` file contains all the SQL queries used to explore and analyze the dataset.
- The `dashboard_screenshots` folder contains images of the Tableau dashboards.
- The `data` folder houses the sales dataset used for this project.

## Conclusion
This project successfully leveraged SQL and Tableau tools to convert raw sales data into a clear narrative, aiding in strategic decision-making for business growth.
